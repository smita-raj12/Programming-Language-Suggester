      <strong> Python</strong> is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming 
      language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable 
      use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented 
      approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale 
      projects.<br>
      Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming 
      paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and 
      functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language 
      due to its comprehensive standard library.[31]
      Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the 
      ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[32] 
      Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions 
      and a garbage collection system using reference counting. Python 3.0 was released 
      in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible 
      and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. Python 2 was discontinued with 
      version 2.7.18 in 2020.<br>
      Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.
