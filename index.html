      <strong> Python</strong> is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming 
      language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable 
      use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented 
      approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale 
      projects.<br>
      Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming 
      paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and 
      functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language 
      due to its comprehensive standard library.[31]
      Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the 
      ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[32] 
      Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions 
      and a garbage collection system using reference counting. Python 3.0 was released 
      in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible 
      and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. Python 2 was discontinued with 
      version 2.7.18 in 2020.<br>
      Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.

    <p>We suggest <em>JavaScript,C/C++ and Java for less coding</em><br>
    <strong>JavaScript</strong>often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language 
    that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[9] JavaScript is high-level, 
    often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, 
    dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World 
    Wide Web.[10] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,
    often incorporating third-party libraries.[12] All major web browsers have a 
    dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.<br>
    As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, 
    and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces 
    (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, 
    and the Document Object Model (DOM).<br>

    <strong>C/C++</strong>is a general-purpose programming language created by 
    Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".
    The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented,
    generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory 
    manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many 
    vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, 
    Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.<br>
    C++ was designed with an orientation toward system programming and embedded, 
    resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, 
    and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[10] C++ has also been found 
    useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure 
    and resource-constrained applications,[10] including desktop applications, 
    video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical 
    applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).<br>

    <strong>JAVA</strong> is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming 
    language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
    It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application 
    developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code 
    can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
    Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java 
    virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 
    The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities 
    than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities 
    (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available 
    in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular 
    programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server 
    web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.<br>
