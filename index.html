      <strong> Python</strong> is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming 
      language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable 
      use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented 
      approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale 
      projects.<br>
      Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.<br>

  <div id="JavaScript">
    <p><span class="p-class">We suggest <em>JavaScript,C/C++ and Java</em> for less coding</span><br>
    <strong>JavaScript</strong>often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language 
    that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, 
    often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, 
    dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World 
    Wide Web.[10] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,
    often incorporating third-party libraries.[12] All major web browsers have a 
    dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.<br>

    <strong>C/C++</strong>is a general-purpose programming language created by 
    Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".
    The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented,
    generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory 
    manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many 
    vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, 
    Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.<br>

    <strong>JAVA</strong> is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming 
    language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
    It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application 
    developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code 
    can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
    Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java 
    virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 
    The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities 
    than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities 
    (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available 
    in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular 
    programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server 
    web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.<br>

  <div id="Ruby">
    <p><span class="p-class">For Back-end we suggest <em>Ruby/Rails, SQL and MongoDB </em></span> <br>

      <strong>Ruby on Rails, or Rails</strong>, is a server-side web application 
      framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. Rails is a model–view–controller 
      (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and 
      web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or 
      XML for data transfer and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for user interfacing. In addition 
      to MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known software engineering patterns 
      and paradigms, including convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself 
      (DRY), and the active record pattern.<br>

      <strong> SQL(Structured Query Language)</strong> is a domain-specific language 
      used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database 
      management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream 
      management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, 
      i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables.<br>
      SQL offers two main advantages over older read–write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. 
      Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single 
      command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, 
      e.g. with or without an index.<br>

      <strong>MongoDB</strong>MongoDB is a document database built on a scale-out architecture 
      that has become popular with developers of all kinds who are building scalable applications 
      using agile methodologies.
      MongoDB was built for people who are building internet and business applications who 
      need to evolve quickly and scale elegantly. If you are doing that, you should consider 
      MongoDB.

  <div id="React">
    <p><span class="p-class">For front-end we suggest <em>React, Angular </em></span> <br>
      <strong>React</strong>(also known as <strong>React.js</strong> or<strong>ReactJS</strong>)
      is an open-source front-end JavaScript library[3] for building user interfaces or 
      UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers 
      and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or 
      mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and 
      rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires 
      the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.<br>

      <strong>Angular</strong> (commonly referred to as "Angular 2+" or "Angular v2 
      and above") is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework led by 
      the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. 
      Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.<br>
      Angular is used as the frontend of the MEAN stack, consisting of MongoDB database,
      Express.js web application server framework, Angular itself (or AngularJS), and 
      Node.js server runtime environment.<br>

  <div id="Swift">
    <p> For limited time we suggest <em>Swift</em><br>
      <strong>Swift</strong> is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled 
      programming language developed by Apple Inc. and the open-source community, 
      first released in 2014. Swift was developed as a replacement for Apple's earlier 
      programming language Objective-C, as Objective-C had been largely unchanged since 
      the early 1980s and lacked modern language features. Swift works with Apple's 
      Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, and a key aspect of Swift's design was the 
      ability to interoperate with the huge body of existing Objective-C code developed 
      for Apple products over the previous decades. It is built with the open source 
      LLVM compiler framework and has been included in Xcode since version 6, released 
      in 2014. On Apple platforms, it uses the Objective-C runtime library which allows 
      C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program.
